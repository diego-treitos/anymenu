# anymenu

With `anymenu` you can create your own menus and submenus with multiple purposes. It is an incredibly simple script and design, but I didn't find anything similar so I coded it.

In this example, I include a power menu to control the system *reboot*, *shutdown*, *hibernation*, etc; a network menu using helper scripts that use `nmcli` underneath and other minor examples.


## Installation

1. Copy `anymenu` script anywhere in your `PATH`.

2. Copy the `menus` and `helpers` directories to `$HOME/.config/anymenu/`.

## Configuration

Just check the examples in the `menus` directory. You can modify the existing ones and create new ones.
